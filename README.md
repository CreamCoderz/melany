Melany for Wordpress
====================

This is my first WordPress theme named Melany. This name doesn't have any specific meaning, I just like it. Some time ago I opened a blog on http://deshack.altervista.org and I wanted to focus on the content, so I choose the "Custom Community" theme by Themekraft, promising myself I would find the time to develop my own. So here we are: it's free, but I'd like you to report credits when you use it.

Based on _s
===========

There's plenty of starter themes on the Internet, but they're mostly parent themes: not very cool to use and distribute the derivative work. Thanks God, I found this toolbox by ThemeShaper, _s, and I must say that's great!

Built with Twitter Bootstrap
============================

Twitter Bootstrap is a powerful framework that allows a faster and easier web development. That's not only its description, it's reality. Because it's very powerful, I decided to use it for this project.

The content, everywhere
=======================

I don't like that kind of layout that highlights the look instead of the content, at least on blogs. Melany is meant to be clear, linear, and make people enjoy the contents, everywhere, from the desktop to the smarphone.

Features
========

Melany is meant to be simple, for everyone, without plugins, simply via the Theme Customizer (Appearance > Themes > Melany > Customize).
You can:
* Display a logo at the top of the sidebar
* Display Social Icons linked to your profile at the top of the sidebar, under site description

The following Social Network are supported:
* Google+
* Facebook
* Twitter
* GitHub
The last not being a social network, but it is useful for developers.

To show these icons, simply go to the Theme Customizer > Social Icons.

= Google+ ID =

You can find it in your profile's URL. Let me make an example:

URL: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111208809586814306110/posts

ID: 111208809586814306110

= Facebook ID =

That's in your profile's URL too:

URL: https://www.facebook.com/mattia.migliorini
ID: mattia.migliorini

= Twitter Username =

Your Twitter Username (without @).

= GitHub Username =

Your GitHub Username.

Changelog
=========

V 0.3
* Added Social Icons (see "Features" section)
* Some optimizations for mobile devices
* Bug fixes
